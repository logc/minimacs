# Minimacs

My personal Emacs configuration

## Installation

```shell
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/logc/minimacs ~/.emacs.d
```

Then start Emacs as you would normally do.

## Usage

Minimacs uses key bindings that start with `SPC`. You can discover them by pressing the space bar after Emacs finishes loading.

`M-x` is remapped to `SPC SPC` for quick access.
