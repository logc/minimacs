## Installation

```shell
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/logc/minimacs ~/.emacs.d
```

Then start Emacs as you would normally do.

## Usage

Minimacs installs modes for the development of Scala and Python, and also for writing Org files.

Minimacs only allows two monochrome themes: Tao dark and Tao light. By default, the light theme is selected.

Minimacs uses key bindings inspired by Doom Emacs. You can discover them by pressing the space bar after Emacs finishes loading.
